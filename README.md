This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to analyzing biological networks, focusing on the interactions and relationships between various biological entities.
It provides a comprehensive analysis of biological networks, including data processing, visualization, and interpretation of results.

The biological network data used in this project is sourced from Hetionet â€” an integrative network of biomedical knowledge that links drugs, diseases, genes, and more to facilitate network-based predictions and analysis.
